		<p>Best Mexican I've had in a long time.  I'd reccommend the pork carnitas that come with pickled onions. Everything served at the restaurant is locally grown/raised, and you can tell.  Everything is SO fresh, especially the guacamole and sour cream. Great portions; they fill the plate with enough to make you full and satisfied, but not so full that you feel like dying. Fantastic table service.</p>
		<p>This is a great place to take locals and guests alike. Wonderful dining atmosphere, casual bar/lounge area and a nice outdoor patio for the summer. Also large banquet areas are a plus for a company party, etc. The food here is now very consistent and the menu does change from time to time which is nice. The margaritas are pricey but do compliment the meal well. Last time had the Chile relleno and pulled pork. The Chile was perfect- nice crispy breading, but not an overcooked mushy pepper inside. Very tasty. </p> </div>
		<p>Pretty freaking good stuff.  Think In-n-Out, then double the price.  Haha.   They  give you a ton of fries which is nice.</p>
		<p>Close contender for the best burger I have ever eaten. Both my kids loved it.  The atmosphere was fun and the service was excellent. We will definitely make the drive to eat there again. </p>
